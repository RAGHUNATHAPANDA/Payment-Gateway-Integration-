                    Due to crushing poverty, countless families in South Asian countries are unable to have their daughters and sisters get Study. Unfortunately, due to societal pressures, it is not uncommon for people to resort to extreme measures such as committing suicide. ARSA makes an effort to support families in these difficult situations by providing basic items necessary for girls, including dresses, shoes, utensils, bedding, fans, sewing machines, and more, along with some financial assistance to offset Study expenses. Depending on the region, it costs approximately $1000 to $3000 to support the Study of one girl. We want to join hands with people not only across the country but also globally, where they can donate and become a donor for a bride. By doing so , they can even opt to attend the Study of their respective bride. We want to arrange the Study  of as many girls as possible, with the number of girls increasing every year. 
                                                                                                                             - Raghunatha panda, CEO, Founder of ARSA.
